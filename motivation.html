			<h2 class="first">Motivation Theory:</h2>
				<p class="second"> Motivation is the reason for peoples actions, willingness and goals. There are 4 types of motivation. Extrinsic motivation, which is a motivation that we find outside ourselves, Intrinsic motivation is the motivation that comes from within and is considered a reason of being (ikigai), Introjected motivation is the same as intrinsic motivation but leaves the person with guilt if its not done. and identified motivation where a person knows that something needs to be done but has yet decided to do anything about it. </p>
					<h2 class="dan"> Ted Talk: Dan Pink</h2>
						<p class="fourth">- According to him, what is motivation?<br>

				Motivation is based around 2 facts. Intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Back in the day when companies wanted to see growth, they often stimulated their employees with extrinsic motivators. They gave you a task to do and reward you with money or some external way of appreciation. According to what Daniel explains those ways of motivation are actually holding back most of the people of their own growth and creativity and let business stagnate.<br>
				
				- What determines someone’s motivation?<br>
				
				According to science Daniel explains 3 element that are stimulating people intrinsicly and shows a tremendous increase in creativity and growth in business.<br>
				Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives<br>
				Mastery: the desire to get better at something that matters<br>
				Purpose: the earning to do in the service of something bigger then ourselves<br>
				
				
				- How can you influence and manage your own motivation?<br>
				Daniel explained that this new way of motivating people instrinsicly is implemented in a lot of big tech companies and the results are remarkable. Those companies gave their employees more autonomy throughout the year. They wanted them to spend more time of their work on their own projects, this causes people to feel more autonomous in various ways and new innovative ideas were born.

							<h2 class="first">Score</h2>
								<p class="second">
									Are you Intrinsically or Extrinsically Motivated?
									For 70% you are: You are primarily intrinsically motivated. You are able to enjoy yourself in almost any activity, because you tend to engage in an activity for its own sake. You find what you do to be enjoyable, and that is enough of a reason for you to do anything.
									74% of 4439 quiz participants had this profile! Profile A
						
									You could also get this result:
									For 20% you are: You are obviously lying. You need to take a long, hard look at yourself. Profile B
						
									Or even this one:
									For 10% you are: You are not motivated. At all. Where did you even find the incentive to take this quiz? Profile C
						
									Or even this one:
									For 0% you are: You are primarily extrinsically motivated. You prefer to let outside factors dictate your actions. You tend to focus more on the finish line instead of the race. It usually takes an external incentive like money or grades to get you going. This can include negative motivation such as losing money or threats. This kind of attitude can really undermine your creative side. You might want to rethink your motives a little, you may find that some of your best work comes from being self-motivated. Profile D

									<h2 class="first">Summarize</h2>
										<p class="third">
											The four most important statements from my test were: Structure, Influence, Creativity, Performance. I agree with these statements because I recognize them in my experiences in life. I find structure very important and notice that in combination with discipline it’s a very good skill to have. When it comes to Influence I recognize that I find it important that I have a influence and being eager to contribute to dialog on important decisions and influencing the organization. Creativity is something I notice is worth a lot to me because it means I can find use this skill to solve any solution in a out-of-the-box thinkin way. Creativity makes me adapt easier and teaches me to see problems form out a different perspective. And as last Performance. The motivation that I feel to succeed with ICT is linked to the fact that I want to perform high as a person in the previous explained skills. My performance tells me where I succeed in and also gives me feedback on what to improve. Being realistic and honest to myself gives me the power to acknowledge my mistakes and adapt where is needed.

													<p class="second">Structure: one example when it comes to structure is my previous job. the hours that I had to work differ from late shift to early shift to night shifts. I notice that this really hard to adapt to for your body and mind. That why I prefer the structure that school provide right now. You work from Monday to Friday within a certain time.

																		Influence: one example when it comes to influence is also about my previous job. When there was a multidisciplinary meeting about a client a lot of doctors and psychologist gave their opinion without even seeing the client that often. I often had to speak up and told them my view of how to handle a specific client since im working with them every day. This grew over the last years and gave me a lot of confidence to speak up.  
								
																		Autonomy: Autonomy came out the test as least important anchor. While I don’t really agree on that, I have to say that right now I depent a lot on other people in order to succeed my first year in school. This was also the case in my previous job where the first year I had depent a lot on my coworkers. Later on I got more autonomous and could easily run a department with just one coworker.

															<h2 class="first">Conclusion</h2>
																<p class="second">The conclusion about my own motivation is that I really notice how driven I am and would love to work within IT. I see some herds to take and I am aware of the fact that this studie will come with his ups and downs. Bottom line, im learning and I love it.</p>
																	<h2 class="first">Feedback</h2>
																		<p class="second">I asked my sibling who also went with me to the open day. His feedback to me was that this website looks slick and simple at the same time. He wonders how my skills will develop over the next years.</p>
